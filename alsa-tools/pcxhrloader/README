    pcxhrloader - Firmware loader for Digigram pcxhr compatible soundcards
	    Digigram <alsa@digigram.com>


GENERAL
=======

pcxhrloader is a helper program to load the firmware binaries
onto Digigram's pcxhr compatible board sound drivers.
The following modules require this program:
	snd-pcxhr
These drivers don't work properly at all until the certain firmwares
are loaded, i.e. no PCM nor mixer devices will appear.


USAGE
=====

When pcxhrloader is invoked without options, it will probe all existing
soundcards until a valid pcxhr-driver is found.  If a valid pcxhr-driver is
found, pcxhrloader reads the board type from the driver.  The corresponding
firmware binaries are then read and transferred to the driver.
Finally, pcxhrloader initializes the PCM and the mixer devices on the
driver for making the soundcard full functional.

Instead of auto-probing, you can specify the card number or the hwdep
device name via -c and -D options, respectively.

	% pcxhrloader -c 1
	% pcxhrloader -D hw:0

For loading the firmware automatically after the module is loaded, use
the post-install command.  For example, add the following entry to
/etc/modules.conf for pcxhr driver:

	post-install snd-pcxhr /usr/bin/pcxhrloader

FILES
=====

The firmware binaries are installed on /usr/share/alsa/firmware/pcxhrloader
(or /usr/local/share/alsa/firmware/pcxhrloader, depending to the prefix
option of configure).  There will be *.conf files, which define the dsp image
files for each different card type.

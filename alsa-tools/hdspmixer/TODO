Future plans :
    * add latest Totalmix features (matrix view ?)
    * midi automation (alsa seq)
    * ladcca support
    * integrate with freedesktop.org's notification area (systray like)

Thoughts :
    * switch to OpenGL for faster meter rendering
    * import/export presets in the windows/mac format
